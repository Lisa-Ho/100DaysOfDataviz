Head to [this site](https://100daysofdataviz.notion.site/100-Days-of-Data-viz-5b717906c4a4475fb92f9503884078bc) where I post my data viz creations and write about what I learned.

Some of my goals:

1. Continue improving in Pythonâ€™s matplotlib
1. Learn ggplot2 library from R
2. Practice making data viz in D3
3. Get better at making maps in QGIS
